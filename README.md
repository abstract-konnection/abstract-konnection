Welcome to Abstract Konnection, a mock e-commerce web app!

### Mission Statement
"Here at Abstract Konnection, we believe that artists have the ability to influence social change.
Artists come in every shape and size regardless of age, ethnicity, race, socioeconomic status, gender, sexual orientation and religion.
That being said, we hope you enjoy perusing through our art collection where we have intentionally left out the artist’s
name as well as title of the piece. Please feel free to click on an image to see more details on the artwork.  

You will see that we sell art pieces by lesser known artists, who may have been born just a few years ago! Here at abstract connection, we believe that purchasing good art should be accessible to everyone. Thanks to our donors, we are able to sell our art pieces at a reduced price and is still able to fairly compensate the
artist"

## Installation
1. Clone this repo:
```sh
git@github.com:abstract-konnection/abstract-konnection.git
```
2. Sync and seed your database by running `npm run seed`. Running `npm run start:dev` will make great things happen!

- start:dev will both start your server and build your client side files using webpack
- start:dev:logger is the same as start:dev, but you will see your SQL queries (can be helpful for debugging)
- start:dev:seed will start your server and also seed your database (this is useful when you are making schema changes and you don’t want to run your seed script separately)
3. Go to http://localhost:8080/ on your browser.
