# Abstract Konnection

Welcome to our web application! Here is the mission statement of our site:
” Here at Abstract Konnection, we believe that artists have the ability to influence social change.
Artists come in every shape and size regardless of age, ethnicity, race, socioeconomic status, gender, sexual orientation and religion.
That being said, we hope you enjoy perusing through our art collection where we have intentionally left out the artist’s
name as well as title of the piece. Please feel free to click on an image to see more details on the artwork.”

## Docs

We have added some documentation and added it to Notion. This is the link:

### Start

Sync and seed your database by running `npm run seed`. Running `npm run start:dev` will make great things happen!

- start:dev will both start your server and build your client side files using webpack
- start:dev:logger is the same as start:dev, but you will see your SQL queries (can be helpful for debugging)
- start:dev:seed will start your server and also seed your database (this is useful when you are making schema changes and you don’t want to run your seed script separately)
